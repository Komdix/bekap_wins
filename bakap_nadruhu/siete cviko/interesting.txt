Inovation in protocol QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections)

QUIC is modern network protocol originaly made by Google and and then standardized by 
organization IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). It is build on UDP and is designed 
to provide faster and more secure comunication of web aplications. Its key function is ability 
to combine phase of making connection and data transfer. this significantly fasten the latency
during the connection. 

QUIC also makes a strong emphasis on security. Integrates encryption on transport layer
(TLS) as a standard feature. this deffers from TCP which has TLS as an option not a necessity.
This feature ensures that all comunications with QUIC are secure. Additionally QUIC improves 
reliability over TCP by allowing independent flow control in multiple streams, enhancing overall
communications reliability. This innovation has a impact on the application layer. It could 
lead to more responsive and secure applications, and improve user experience in web browsing and
content streaming.
